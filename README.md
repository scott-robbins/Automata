# Automata

## Examples 
* *GOL.py* - Conway's Game of Life
* *parity.py* - Automata Simulation example based on parity rules. 
* *bacterial.py* - Taking a random bitplane, forms interesting bodies.
* *liquid_crystal.py* - Using parity rules, and starting with different
intentional initial states, interesting patterns emerge.
